# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Time Series Forecasting

This project is part of a Data Analytics Internship. It aims to analyze and forecast stock market trends using various time series models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM. The project involves working with real stock market data to gain insights, evaluate model accuracy, and visualize predictions.

---

## ðŸš€ Objectives

- Understand time series concepts: trend, seasonality, noise, and stationarity.
- Collect and preprocess historical stock market data.
- Apply forecasting models: ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM.
- Evaluate and compare model performance.
- Visualize results through dashboards.
- Optionally deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Prophet, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Deployment (optional)**: Streamlit or Flask
